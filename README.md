# Emotion Detection Web App 🎭

This is a web-based application built with **Flask (Python)** that analyzes user input text and determines the associated emotion. The application identifies emotions such as **Joy, Anger, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust**.

Currently, the application runs on **local logic** (keyword-based analysis), allowing it to function completely offline without requiring external API keys or internet access.

Run:
In bash:
pip install flask
python app.py 

Open http://localhost:5000
